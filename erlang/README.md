Cppcheck Your Code
===

### Introduction
The purpose of this talk is to offer a concise view of program analysis, especially static program analysis, using `Cppcheck` as a tool. 
* the levels at which a program analysis can be performed; 
* program analysis and possible approaches in performing it; 
* Cppcheck presentation, both from an architectural and practical standpoints

The purpose of this presentation is to describe the Erlang programming language together with a few concepts that entail a better understanding of the context. The presentation will cover the following aspects:
* consistency models and examples
* concurrency and parallelism and the difference between them
* concurrency models 
* the Actor mode
* the Erlang programming language
* programming examples
