Insufficient Process Validation
===

### Introduction
The purpose of this talk is to cover how `Insufficient Process Validation` occurs when a Web Application fails to prevent an attacker from circumventing the intended flow or business logic of the application [1]. For example, if the user state through a process is not sufficiently well verified, the Web Site is vulnerable to exploitation or fraud.
