Natural/unconventional interfaces and game resurrection
=====

### Introduction
The purpose of this presentation is twofold. Firstly, we explore unconventional user interfaces (e.g. haptic, speech, olfactory, etc.) which become an increasingly prevalent mode of interaction. Secondly, we describe an open-source game (i.e. TeTwix, Website: https://github.com/danielamariei/tetwix) which proposes a modern version of the classical electronic game Tetris by adopting these new user interaction techniques.

#### Nontraditional interfaces
In this section of the presentation, we expose the main characteristics for each interaction method, as well as the general context which enables them to be used as a day-to-day technology. Several examples are also included.

#### Tetris GamR (Game Resurrection) 
We describe the main aspects of our developed game. As the game proposes a modern version of Tetris, it supports multiplayer game modes, while user(s) are able to use natural I/O devices and interaction methods such as: gestural (Leap Motion), locomotion (Makey Makey), etc. The game is attractive for various population segments and can be used as a means for having fun or to carry out cardio exercises, a serious game, and many others.
